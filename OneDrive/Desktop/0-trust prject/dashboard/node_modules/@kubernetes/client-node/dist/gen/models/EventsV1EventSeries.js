* EventSeries contain information on series of events, i.e. thing that was/is happening continuously for some time. How often to update the EventSeries is up to the event reporters. The default event reporter in \"k8s.io/client-go/tools/events/event_broadcaster.go\" shows how this struct is updated on heartbeats and can guide customized reporter implementations.
