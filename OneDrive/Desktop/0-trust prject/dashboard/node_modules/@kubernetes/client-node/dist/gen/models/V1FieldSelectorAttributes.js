/**
* FieldSelectorAttributes indicates a field limited access. Webhook authors are encouraged to * ensure rawSelector and requirements are not both set * consider the requirements field if set * not try to parse or consider the rawSelector field if set. This is to avoid another CVE-2022-2880 (i.e. getting different systems to agree on how exactly to parse a query is not something we want), see https://www.oxeye.io/resources/golang-parameter-smuggling-attack for more details. For the *SubjectAccessReview endpoints of the kube-apiserver: * If rawSelector is empty and requirements are empty, the request is not limited. * If rawSelector is present and requirements are empty, the rawSelector will be parsed and limited if the parsing succeeds. * If rawSelector is empty and requirements are present, the requirements should be honored * If rawSelector is present and requirements are present, the request is invalid.
